# Overview

In this section we will walk through how to use R analyze experiments that are part of standard new method validations. We will use real data acquired as part of a method transition for immunoassays (unconjugated estriol, alpha fetoprotein, and inhibin-A) used for prenatal assessment of Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, and open neural tube defect risk assessment.


# Load data

Relatively "clean" data has been organized in separate tabs in an excel document. Let's first load one of these data sets.

```{r load_data_1}
dat <- read_excel(path="data/Maternal Serum AFP HCG uE3 DxI raw data.deaccessioned.xlsx", 
                sheet="MS AFP", 
                col_names=TRUE)
```


Let's next take a look at the data

```{r}
dat
```
