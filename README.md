## Preparing for the course

The easiest way to get up and running with the content (to decrease set up time) is to follow these instructions a couple days before the course:

1. Navigate to the course webpage: (https://github.com/pcmathias/AACC-Introduction-to-R)
1. Download the .zip file with the repository contents using the "Clone or download" button (near the top right) and select "Download ZIP"
1. Unzip the file to a convenient destination that you will remember
1. Select "Set Working Directory" from the Session menu at the top of the screen in RStudio, then navigate to that location. 

After you complete these steps, you will be able to open up the course files in RStudio, run completed lines or chunks of code, and fill in the blanks for exercises.
