This course is intended as an introduction for clinical laboratory professionals who have limited to no knowledge of computer programming or of the R language. The easiest way to get up and running with the content (if you are not familiar with git) is to download a .zip file with the repository contents using the "Clone or download" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Unzip the file to a convenient destination that you will remember and use the Files tab (bottom right) in RStudio to navigate to that location. You can then open up the course files in RStudio, run completed lines or chunks of code, and fill in the blanks for exercises.
