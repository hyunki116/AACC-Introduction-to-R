# Overview

In this section we will continue exploring how to use R in method validation by comparing results from two different methods.

# Load data

Let's load in hCG data, just as we did in the previous session.

# Describe data and explore its distribution

Let's briefly describe data, as we did previously.

# Method comparison 
## Quantitative
### Simple linear regression
### Deming regression
### Passing-Bablock

## Compare methods by concordance relative to decision thresholds

# Confusion matrix

Let's assume that the previous method was our gold standard.

## Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV
