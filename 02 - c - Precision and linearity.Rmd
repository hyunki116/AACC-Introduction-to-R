# Overview

In this section we will continue exploring how to use R in method validation by studying precision, linearity, and calibration verification.

# Precision

## Load data

-- TODO: need to swap out data in excel document. Have placeholder data in tab "Precision"

## Describe data and explore its distribution

Let's briefly describe data, as we did previously.

## LOB

## LOQ

# Linearity and Calibration verification

## Load data

-- TODO: need to add data to excel document
# ? Multivariate analyses
## ? Pairwise plots
## ? Co-linearity
